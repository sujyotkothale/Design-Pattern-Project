# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

This repository contains a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implementing various design patterns to enhance its functionality and structure.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### Singleton
- Utilized for the game launcher to ensure only one instance is accessible throughout the gameplay session, managing resources efficiently.

### Factory
- Used to create different sizes of the game board dynamically (3x3, 4x4, 5x5), providing varying complexity levels for gameplay.

### Proxy
- Employed to validate player names, ensuring uniqueness and preventing players from having identical names during the gaming session.

### Template
- Defines the structure of the game, facilitating easy customization and extension of game rules while maintaining a consistent gameplay framework.

## Features

- Java Swing-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a user-friendly gaming experience.
- Customizable colors for two players.
- Option to select different backgrounds.
- Supports various sizes of Tic-Tac-Toe grids including 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.
